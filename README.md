## Description
The **Student Enrollment Form** is a web-based form designed for enrolling students into an educational institution. This form is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It captures important student details such as **Roll Number**, **Full Name**, **Class**, **Birth Date**, **Address**, and **Enrollment Date**. 

This project also integrates with **JsonPowerDB**, a fast, real-time database designed for handling structured and unstructured data. JsonPowerDB is used here to store and retrieve student data through APIs, which enhances the performance and scalability of the system.

## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB
- **Real-time Data Processing**: JsonPowerDB offers instant query processing, making it ideal for real-time applications like this student enrollment form.
- **Schema-Free**: JsonPowerDB stores data in JSON format, which does not require predefined schemas. This makes the system flexible and adaptable to various data types.
- **High Performance**: JsonPowerDB is designed to handle large volumes of data with minimal overhead, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Easy API Integration**: With JsonPowerDB, integrating data operations (such as saving and retrieving records) via APIs is quick and simple.
- **RESTful Support**: JsonPowerDB supports RESTful API requests, which are easy to consume and integrate into web applications.

3. **Update Functionality**: Allows users to update existing student records based on Roll No.
4. **Form Reset**: Resets the form fields to their initial state.
5. **API Integration**: Uses JsonPowerDBâ€™s PUT and GET requests to interact with the database.

The functionalities are implemented using **jQuery** and **AJAX** for smooth interaction with the backend.
